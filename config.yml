# The production config uses a few different paths to load files.
# There are also only some image dimensions specified by default.

# This production environment should be accessed via a separate virtualhost.
# An Apache example of such host configuration could be:
#
# <VirtualHost *:80>
#     DocumentRoot "<path_to_project>/public"
#     ServerName stitcher.local
#     ErrorLog "<log_path>/error.log"
#     CustomLog "<log_path>/access.log" common
#
#     <Directory "<path_to_project>/public">
#         AllowOverride All
#         Require all granted
#     </Directory>
# </VirtualHost>

# Configure the paths of several directories
directories:
    # The source directory containing
    src: ./src

    # The public directory in which the site is generated
    public: ./public

    # Cache directory used by smarty
    cache: ./.cache

# Configure which image versions should be created
image:
    dimensions:
        960x640: { width: 690, height: 640}
        1024x768: { width: 1024, height: 768}
        1920x1080: { width: 1920, height: 1080}
        1600x1200: { width: 1600, height: 1200}

# Configure meta tags
meta:
    viewport: width=device-width, initial-scale=1

# Minify CSS and JavaScript
minify: true

# Choose the template engine. Available options: smarty, twig
engine: smarty
