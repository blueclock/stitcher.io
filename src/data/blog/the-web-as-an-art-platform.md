# The web as an art platfom

Many of us probably heard of this new sports website launched a few weeks ago: [https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football](*https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football).

It made me think
What defines a website?
It made use of minimalistic design
No technical magic, or at least nothing visible
The first time I wasn't thinking about performance or UX when vitisting a website.
It was an emotional experience
It makes you think about the web as a platform.

> quote about what the original goal of the web was

The web is more than commercial, informational or application platforms.
This was an experience.
