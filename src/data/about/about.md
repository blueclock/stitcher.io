# About Stitcher and myself

My name is Brent, I'm a 22 years old web developer living in Belgium. My interest in websites and web development started around the age of 12, and I've been coding ever since. I've finished my bachelor degree "Applied Informatics" in Leuven in 2014.

The last two years, I've been working for a company named [Statik](*https://www.statik.be), where I'm a backend PHP developer. Besides my daytime job, I also work on some side projects to help churches and Christian organisations in my area. And on top of that, the cherry on the cake, my own favourite project: Stitcher, in which I try to push myself and websites to a whole new level.

The idea behind Stitcher originated early 2016, when a lot of "predictions for the web in 2016" blog posts appeared. Some performance issues caught my eye, and made me think about what a website really is. After a year of tinkering, tryouts and development, Stitcher was born. If you want to know exactly what Stitcher is about, you can read [the guide](*/guide/setting-up).

Do you have any more questions? Want to talk about PHP- and web development, web performance or anything else? Feel free to send me [an e-mail](mailto:brendt@stitcher.io).
