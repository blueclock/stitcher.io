Stitcher sites can be built by anyone with basic HTML knowledge: **data entries** are mapped onto **templates** which are accessible via **a URL**.
These two components (entries and templates) are mapped - *stitched* - together via a **config file**. Data entries can be provided in many ways:
JSON or YAML files, MarkDown files, images, SASS or CSS, JavaScript, folders and more.

The goal is simple: create blazing fast websites. Stitcher will parse all your templates into static HTML pages, will parse and minify CSS and JavaScript,
 will optimize images using ``srcset`` and provides useful developer tools to aid you in setting things up smoothly.
